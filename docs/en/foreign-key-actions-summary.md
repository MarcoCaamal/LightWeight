# Enhancement Summary: Support for Referential Actions in Foreign Keys

> üåê [Documentaci√≥n en Espa√±ol](../es/foreign-key-actions-summary.md)

## Overview

Full support for `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` clauses in foreign keys has been implemented in the LightWeight migration system. This enhancement allows developers to specify behaviors for handling referential integrity when related records are deleted or updated.

## Implemented Features

1. **`onDelete()` and `onUpdate()` Methods**
   - Added to the `ForeignKeyDefinition` class to specify referential actions
   - Support for all standard MySQL actions: CASCADE, SET NULL, RESTRICT, NO ACTION, SET DEFAULT

2. **Referential Action Validation**
   - Implemented `validateReferentialAction()` method that normalizes and validates actions
   - Error handling for incorrect values with descriptive messages

3. **Enhanced SQL Generation**
   - Updated `compileForeignKey()` method to correctly generate ON DELETE and ON UPDATE clauses
   - Maintained compatibility with existing migrations

4. **Smart Constraint Names**
   - Improved naming system that considers referential actions to avoid collisions
   - Optimized algorithm for generating constraint names that respect MySQL's 64 character limit

5. **Identifier Shortening**
   - Enhanced `shortenIdentifier()` method with advanced techniques to preserve name semantics
   - Removal of common words, intelligent handling of vowels, and hash usage for very long identifiers

## Testing

Two test sets have been implemented to verify functionality:

1. **General Foreign Key with Actions Test**
   - Integrated in `BlueprintForeignKeyTest::testForeignKeyActions()`
   - Verifies the correct creation of ON DELETE and ON UPDATE clauses

2. **Specific Referential Action Tests**
   - New `BlueprintForeignKeyActionsTest` file with multiple test cases
   - Tests for each individual action and combinations
   - Performance tests to verify constraint name generation

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:

1. **Main referential actions guide**
   - `foreign-key-actions.md` file with detailed explanation of the functionality
   - Description of each available action and its behavior

2. **Practical examples**
   - `foreign-key-actions-examples.md` file with common use cases
   - Examples for different scenarios: blog, inventory system, academic application

3. **Existing documentation updates**
   - References to the new functionality in `migration-api-reference.md`
   - Important note about the correct method order

4. **Mention in README.md**
   - Highlighting the new functionality in the new features section
   - Links to relevant documentation

## Implementation Notes

- **Method Chain Handling**: The implementation requires `onDelete()` and `onUpdate()` methods to be called before `on()`.
- **Normalization**: Actions are normalized and validated to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Improvements made while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

## Future Work

Possible improvements to consider in the future:

1. Support for referential actions in down migration operations.
2. More flexible interface for method order in the chain.
3. Support for additional MySQL options like MATCH FULL/PARTIAL.
4. CLI tools to analyze and visualize relationships and actions between tables.

## Team

This functionality was developed by Marco with support from GitHub Copilot.
